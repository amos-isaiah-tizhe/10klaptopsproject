## #10KLaptopsProject – Demo Landing Page

This is a demo landing page built for the #10KLaptopsProject.

It’s not a production website and not a world-standard web app.
The page was created strictly for a challenge/demo purpose.

## Notes

This is just a demo

Buttons and interactions are for display only

Content is used to showcase UI, not official deployment

Built for learning, practice, and challenge submission 

If you want an even shorter version (2–3 lines only) or a commit message style README, say so and I’ll trim it further.
